# smpte2110-demo
A repo with an implementation of rfc 4175 or smpte 2110 in c++11.

The goal is to provide a software only implementation of the RFC4175 spec in c++11 style. Currently working on 10 bit video and payload construction. 
Pull requests are welcome so long as they use c++11 or c++17 styling.
